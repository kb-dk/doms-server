# Script for producing the build environment for the DOMS testbed.

# USAGE: This script will check out specific revisions of the needed
# SourceForge projects, and place them ready for building.
# A directory called "checkouts" will be created in the current directory.
# This is where the downloaded SourceForge package contents will be put.

# The first name of the path is extracted
